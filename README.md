This file is for PyTorch Scholarship in Udacity.com
The project is running on PyTorch 1.0, except for the final project (PyTorch 0.4).
The passage from Pytorch 0.4 to 1.0 has created some changes in programming, especially on data type.
Anyway, the disappearance of Variable in 0.4 is a big step to a good package.
To finish the final project and to upload it to grade, it's better to follow the suggestion on Medium site: no GPU available on grading server. 
I think the future of DL will be on two different branches: one is heavily relying on seris of GPU, another is to find a way in light laptop (no online GPU/CPU). The calculation on local machine is more reliable and easy to manipulate and attractive to industry other than CS.
